# Stock-Market-Prediction-Project-SP500

Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for predicting stock market prices using historical data. It utilizes Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and machine learning models from scikit-learn. The main goal is to analyze stock market trends and predict future prices based on historical patterns.

Features

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization

Feature engineering

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Predictions for future stock prices

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You will also need the following Python libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data

Place your stock market dataset (e.g., CSV format) in the data/ directory. Ensure the dataset contains columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

Running the Notebook

Open stock_market_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess data

Perform exploratory data analysis

Train machine learning models

Generate predictions

Save the outputs in the outputs/ directory.

Key Steps in the Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Convert date columns to datetime objects

Create additional features, e.g., moving averages

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualize stock trends over time

Analyze correlations between features

3. Model Building

Train-Test split

Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

4. Predictions

Use the trained model to predict future stock prices

Visualize actual vs predicted values

Results

The trained models provide predictions for stock prices based on historical data, with performance evaluated using appropriate metrics. Visualizations illustrate the alignment between actual and predicted prices.

Future Work

Incorporate advanced models like LSTMs for time series forecasting

Integrate real-time data for live predictions

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
